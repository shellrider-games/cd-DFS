Your Project Topic: Depth First Search (DFS)

#

### A Short Summary about the Algorithm (What is the Background and the Motivation of having such an algorithm?):

DFS stands for “Depth-First Search”. It is a graph traversal algorithm that explores the graph as far as possible before backtracking. DFS can find cycles and bridges in graphs, find strongly connected components in directed graphs, solve puzzles and mazes and has many more applications. It could also be used for pathfinding, although there exist better algorithms for that use case.

DFS has a time complexity of O(V+E) where V is the number of nodes and E is the number of edges in the graph. In the worst case, DFS must visit every vertex and every edge in the graph (for example if the graph is a List).
